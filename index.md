Hi!

I'm Iulia (iulia not Lulia) and I work in tech, more specifically as a Developer Advocate (aka devrel//tech evangelism/other buzzwords). Currently, I'm @ Elastic.

Basically, I build content & demos with Python, mostly about ML, NLP, LLMs, and semantic search/embeddings/vectors. And you know, search.

You can find me at tech conferences across EMEA (mostly Norther Europe) either at one of our Elastic booths or speaking about Harry Potter for some reason.
I also host the meetups at our Elastic Amsterdam office (one every month, we have pizza!)
